What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git init 			#starts a repository
git status			#status of repositor
git add				#adds a file to staging area -- to be committed 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
Helps you track changes
