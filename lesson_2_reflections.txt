What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git init 			#starts a repository
git status			#status of repositor
git add				#adds a file to staging area -- to be committed 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
Helps you track changes

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
git diff			#compares staging area and working directory
git diff --staged		#compares recent commit to staging area

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
git branch			#shows branches
git branch <name>		#creates a branch with name <name>

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
